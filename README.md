# SoftwareDevelopmentVIMMO

# VIMMO

A Flask-based API application for panel data analysis.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Conda (Miniconda or Anaconda)
- Git.
### For Docker
- Docker Desktop

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/VIMMO.git
cd VIMMO
```

2. Create and activate the conda environment:
```bash
# Create the conda environment from environment.yaml
conda env create -f environment.yaml

# Activate the environment
conda activate VIMMO
```

3. Install the package:
```bash
# Install in development mode
pip install -e .[test]
```

The package installation will automatically handle all dependencies listed in `pyproject.toml`.

### Building the Package for Production

If you want to build the distribution files:
```bash
# This will create both wheel and source distribution
python -m build
```

This will create:
- A wheel file (*.whl) in the `dist/` directory
- A source distribution (*.tar.gz) in the `dist/` directory

Install using:
```bash
# This will create both wheel and source distribution
pip install dist/*.whl
```

## Usage

After installation, you can run the API server:
```bash
# Using the console script
vimmo

# Or using the module directly
python -m vimmo.main
```

The API will be available at:
- Main API: http://127.0.0.1:5001/
- Swagger UI Documentation: http://127.0.0.1:5001/

## Schedule Database Updates

To set up a scheduled cron job on your system to update the 
panel database, run the following command:

```bash
# this will prompt you for input...
dbscheduler
```

### Choose a Schedule

When prompted, type a number and press **Enter** to select the desired schedule:

1. **Every minute**  
2. **Every day at midnight**  
3. **Every week at midnight (Sunday)**  
4. **Every month at midnight (1st)**  
5. **Remove schedule**  

**Enter your choice (1-5):**

### Managing Scheduled Updates

Entering **5** in the dbscheduler will remove the scheduled update. Alternatively, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# To list cron jobs
crontab -l

# To edit the crontab (e.g. to further customise schedule)
crontab -e

# To remove all cron jobs
crontab -r
````


## Version Update
Use after git commit -m "message"
```bash
# Patch version (0.1.0 → 0.1.1) 
bumpversion patch

# Minor version (0.1.0 → 0.2.0):
bumpversion minor

# Major version (0.1.0 → 1.0.0):
bumpversion major
```

## Docker
```bash
# to run docker make sure you are in route directory of the project
cd <your_file_path>/SoftwareDevelopmentVIMMO





# <m>ake sure your docker daemon is running by starting the docker desktop
# Note: requires docker desktop to use the docker compose command

# # to build the image and to run the container 
docker-compose up --build

# to run it in the background use
docker compose up -d --build

#to exit
docker stop my_vimmo_app
docker rm my_vimmo_app

````

## Testing

In root directory (<path>/SoftwareDevelopmentVIMMO) :
Testing requires an instance of the application to be running as it checks for various responses
Please run the App in a seperate terminal or have an instance of Docker running in the background
```bash
pytest #Tests everything

# for extra debugging purposes use 
pytest -s # this prints out some of the info we recieve and should only be used for debugging purposes e.g, change in panelapp or variant validator.

# To test just integration
pytest -m integration

# To test just unittest modules
 pytest -m "not integration"
 #Note: this does not require an instance of the app to run as it mocks responses with dummy data
```

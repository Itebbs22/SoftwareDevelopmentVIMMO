Please check the image to see the build status of each stages


Please Check the log to gain more information but it is really verbose:



In order to run Jenkins in a simpler manner in docker:
1) Setup Docker in Docker image and create a bridge network
2)install Jenkins and setup as per the installation guide (https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/docker/)
3) Once inside create a new item and select pipeline.
4) In the pipeline sectionselect  "Pipeline script from SCM" and provide a git repository url, select branch if necessary and provide the path to Jenkins file
5) Apply and click on build to run the pipeline


Since our Build also manages webhooks to set GitHub status with Success/Failure message (Note can only perform if you own the repository):
1) setup user global credentials and personal access tokens (make sure to enable manage webhooks), see this guide:  https://medium.com/@nikhil.nagarajappa/configuring-the-git-credentials-in-jenkins-4b584a797b45
2) Manage webhooks on Github to send the appropriate payloads to Jenkins see guide https://medium.com/@sangeetv09/how-to-configure-webhook-in-github-and-jenkins-for-automatic-trigger-with-cicd-pipeline-34133e9de0ea
3) make sure jenkins is running on pulic ip either by opening the prot to web traffic or creating a reverse proxy server e.g, (Nginx, ngrok, etc)
4) when configuring Builds, check "GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling" in the build trigger section
5) apply changes
6) Now push a Commit to the branch with the jenkins file and specified in Jenkins Job (Jenkins recommends to only on single branch, please check https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72646757/why-does-jenkins-allow-specifying-multiple-git-branches)
7) should run the CI/CD




Pipeline Steps for Vimmo:
We use docker as agen to build our application virtually

stage 1) Get the docker condinium image
stage 2) set up the conda environment using the environment.yaml and install the application using pip install -e .
stage 3) run unit tests
stage 4) Create and RUN the Docker image using the docker file provided and also run integration tests as it requires the application to be activate to make like requests
stage 5) Clearn up and set git hub status
